Do you believe in love at first sight? How about the first smell? 

Talking about Love. It is a very wired feeling, isn't it?
Ok, It is another subject matter that I have not felt. Just heard from others.

My friends try to explain to me what love is- by the example of some short romantic feeling. Like holding hands, kisses, hugs, dinners, dreams blah blah blah.

Now all this explanation took my sleep away. The "How the heck a person can have such a feeling? Is this true or People are just overwhelming it" Spoiler ALERT -  This is what I use to think before. 
Why in the hell do people blush near their crush?
All questions kept bugging my head, so I did something about it.

Hello everyone Today, I'm gonna break down love in the term of science. Like what makes us feel love. And is it even real or just a fake visualization of our brain?

According to a study published by Harvard University - Love can be categorized into 3 parts, Lust, Attraction, and attachment.

Different chemicals in our body regulate the different parts.
---
---
Let's start with LUST- Lust is driven by sexual desire and a basic need for reproduction.
Sometimes Lust is also defined as a psychological force for producing an intense desire for something.

A glad-named hypothalamus gives a signal to the body to release testosterone in males and estrogen in females. This hormone is commonly known as a male and female hormone. 

This hormone not only drives sexual desire this hormone also helps in mussels, and building. 
This explains why you can perform more reps and more sets when your crush is near you. And this is why you can lift your girlfriend of 60kg but not the LPG gas cylinder.

The second point is- Attraction is gonna explain to you about romantic feelings, insomnia - why you sleep in class but not at night in the hostel, blushing, above loss of appetite, and the rise in heartbeats.

Attraction is similar in feeling to the effect of certain drugs and alcohol.

Let's go chemical- There are 3 major chemicals- Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and serotonin.

Starting with- Dopamine is a chemical made in the adrenal gland. It is also a neurohormone released by the hypothalamus in your brain. Dopamine makes us feel good. The pleasure. And this is why we get addicted to certain people. This is why people wanna watch their partner.  And this is why the eyes of the crush look different than any other. 

Second, the chemical Norepinephrine. This hormone is also produced by the adrenal gland. This chemical increases alertness and attention. This even helps in maintaining blood pressure. When this is released. It increases heartbeats and blood pressure.
Making the blood rush to your face making it red. Due to an increase in cardio activity, we start sweating.

Third serotonin, This substance regulars our mood sleep cycle, and sexual behavior.
This is the reason why people hug and go on dates and dinners and wanna talk to personnel. And all romantic stuff come under this.

I talked about Lust and attraction and now.
Finally Attachment. Attachment is the. Feeling that binds thing, person. It refers to the feeling of closeness.
The major chemicals involve here is Oxytocin.
Also known as the love hormone.

Every one of us here loves our mom, right? Do you know why- this is because of oxytocin. Oxytocin is the same hormone that is released during Breastfeeding. This hormone carries milk from the milk ducts to the nipple during breastfeeding.

Sorry- I got off-topic.

This chemical explains caring behavior towards the person you love. This reminds us of the love of our family. This is why you don't want to damage her or their lungs with the smoke. This is why you want your partner to be successful in the long term. This is why you try to know them better and solve even their problems.
